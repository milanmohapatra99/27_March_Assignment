    "R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness-of-fit of a linear regression model. It provides insights into how well the independent variable(s) (predictor(s)) explain the variation in the dependent variable (response). In simpler terms, R-squared helps us understand the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, R-squared is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    " R^2 = 1 - SS_res/SS_tot\n",
    " \n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- SSres​is the sum of squared residuals, which represents the sum of the squared differences between the actual observed values and the predicted values obtained from the linear regression model.\n",
    "- SS_tot is the total sum of squares, which represents the sum of squared differences between the actual observed values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula essentially measures the proportion of variability in the dependent variable that is captured by the regression model (the ratio of the reduction in sum of squared residuals by the model compared to the total sum of squares).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared values range from 0 to 1, or from 0% to 100%. Here's what different ranges of R-squared values generally imply:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R^2 = 0: The model does not explain any of the variability in the dependent variable. The independent variable(s) have no predictive power.\n",
    "- 0 < R^2 < 1 : The model explains a portion of the variability in the dependent variable. Higher values indicate a better fit, where a larger proportion of the variability is explained by the model.\n",
    "- \\( R^2 = 1 \\): The model perfectly explains all the variability in the dependent variable. This is rare in real-world scenarios and might indicate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that a high R-squared value does not necessarily mean the model is a good fit or that the relationships are causal. R-squared doesn't capture the validity of the model assumptions or the quality of the predictor variables themselves. Additionally, in complex models with multiple predictors, a high R-squared might indicate overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and might not generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, R-squared is a valuable metric for understanding how well a linear regression model fits the data, but it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools and domain knowledge to assess the model's validity and interpretability."

    "Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when you are working with regression models that involve multiple independent variables. It helps address some of the limitations of the regular R-squared and provides a more reliable assessment of model performance, particularly in situations where you have to choose between different models or where overfitting might be a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some scenarios where adjusted R-squared is particularly useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Independent Variables:** When your regression model includes multiple independent variables, the regular R-squared might increase just by adding more predictors, even if those predictors don't actually improve the model's explanatory power. Adjusted R-squared takes into account the number of predictors, providing a more accurate reflection of how well the model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Comparison:** If you're comparing different regression models with varying numbers of predictors, the adjusted R-squared can help you determine which model provides a better balance between fit and complexity. It assists in identifying whether adding more variables leads to a significant improvement in explaining the dependent variable's variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Overfitting:** Adjusted R-squared penalizes models for including unnecessary predictors, reducing the risk of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model captures noise and randomness from the training data, leading to poor generalization to new data. By considering model complexity, adjusted R-squared encourages you to prioritize parsimonious models that have better chances of generalizing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Interpretation:** When presenting your results to non-technical audiences, adjusted R-squared can offer a more realistic understanding of how well your model explains the variation in the dependent variable. It helps you avoid inflating the perceived performance of your model due to the inclusion of irrelevant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Regression with High-Dimensional Data:** In situations where the number of predictors is much larger than the sample size (a scenario known as high-dimensional data), adjusted R-squared can guide you in identifying which variables are truly contributing to the model's performance and which might be noise.\n",
